## About The App
The Meal Finder app is a simple web application that allows users to search for different meal recipes using TheMealDB API. The application uses jQuery to handle DOM manipulations and API requests, with a focus on showcasing jQuery's ability to simplify JavaScript tasks.


## Technologies
The following technologies were used in the project:
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS** & **Bootstrap**: Used for styling the pages, adding responsive and visually appealing components.
- **JavaScript**: Used for adding logic to the application.
- **jQuery**: Used for simplifying JavaScript, handling events, and making AJAX requests to fetch meal information.

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these instructions:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourrepository`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Make sure to have an active internet connection, as the app relies on TheMealDB API.

## Approach
- The app starts by providing an input field and a search button for the user to type a meal name.
- When the search button is clicked, an AJAX request is made to TheMealDB API to search for meal recipes matching the user input.
- The results are displayed dynamically on the page, with each meal displayed as a Bootstrap card that appears with a fade-in effect.

## Status
The Meal Finder app is currently functional but can be improved further:
- Additional features such as saving favorite meals and more filtering options are planned for future releases.
